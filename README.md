# Emotion Recognition Mobile App

A React Native application for emotion recognition using multiple methods including voice analysis, heart rate monitoring, and fusion of both techniques.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¤ Voice Emotion Recognition
- Records and analyzes voice patterns
- Detects emotional states through speech characteristics
- Real-time voice pattern visualization
- Easy-to-use recording interface

### ðŸ’“ Heart Rate Emotion Recognition  
- Monitors heart rate using device camera
- Correlates heart rate variability with emotional states
- Real-time heart rate display
- Heart rate zone indicators

### ðŸ”— Fusion Emotion Recognition
- Combines both voice and heart rate data
- Enhanced accuracy through multi-modal analysis
- Confidence scoring system
- Comprehensive emotional state assessment

## App Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ screens/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ HomeScreen.tsx          # Main navigation hub
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ VoiceEmotionScreen.tsx  # Voice-based emotion detection
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ HeartRateEmotionScreen.tsx # Heart rate-based emotion detection
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ FusionEmotionScreen.tsx # Combined analysis approach
```

## Navigation

The app uses React Navigation with a stack navigator:
- **Home Screen**: Main dashboard with three navigation cards
- **Voice Emotion**: Voice recording and analysis interface
- **Heart Rate Emotion**: Heart rate monitoring interface  
- **Fusion Emotion**: Combined analysis interface
