## Architecture Overview

### Model Integration Strategy

The app is designed to work with three pre-trained .h5 models:

1. **speech_emotion_model (2).h5**
   - Input: 40x174 MFCC features
   - Architecture: LSTM layers with dropout
   - Output: 26 emotion classes (Actor-based labels)
   - Mapped to: Happy, Sad, Angry, Fearful, Disgusted, Surprised, Neutral, Calm

2. **HER_emotion_model (3).h5**
   - Input: 5000-sample ECG signal
   - Architecture: Conv1D + BiLSTM
   - Output: Binary classification (Low/High valence)
   - Enhanced to: 8 emotion states based on HR/HRV patterns

3. **Fusion_emotion_model.h5**
   - Input: Combined speech MFCC (40 features) + HER features
   - Architecture: Gated fusion with residual connections
   - Output: Multimodal emotion prediction
   - Adaptive weighting based on confidence scores

### Current Implementation

**Prediction Logic:**
The emotionAPIService implements sophisticated algorithms that simulate the model behavior:

- **Speech**: Analyzes MFCC energy levels, variance, and spectral features
- **Heart Rate**: Evaluates HR ranges and HRV for emotional state inference
- **Fusion**: Combines predictions with adaptive weights (60/40 speech/HR by default)

**Ready for Backend Integration:**
- Edge Functions can be deployed to Supabase
- Models can be converted to TensorFlow Lite
- API calls are abstracted in emotionAPIService
- Simple configuration change to switch from mock to real inference

## Technical Highlights

### Professional UI/UX
- Material Design-inspired interface
- Smooth animations using React Native Animated API
- Color-coded emotion displays
- Real-time visual feedback
- Intuitive navigation flow
- Responsive layouts

### Data Flow
```
User Input (Audio/HR) 
  → Service Layer (Recording/Monitoring)
    → Feature Extraction
      → Emotion Prediction
        → Results Display
          → Optional: Save to Database
```

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive permission checks
- Graceful fallbacks for missing hardware
- User-friendly error messages
- Proper resource cleanup

### Performance
- Efficient memory management
- Lazy loading of components
- Optimized re-renders
- Background processing for predictions

## Future Enhancements (Ready to Implement)

1. **Backend Integration**
   - Deploy Edge Functions to Supabase
   - Connect to real model inference
   - Set up database persistence

2. **Database Schema**
   - emotion_predictions table ready
   - User authentication integration
   - History tracking and analytics

3. **Additional Features**
   - Emotion trend analysis
   - Export functionality
   - Multi-language support
   - Apple Health integration for iOS

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Permissions Testing**
   - Test on devices with/without permissions
   - Verify graceful permission denial handling

2. **Audio Testing**
   - Record various durations
   - Test playback functionality
   - Verify file cleanup

3. **Heart Rate Testing**

   - Check color contrast and accessibility

## Known Limitations

1. **Model Integration**: Currently using intelligent mock predictions
2. **iOS Health**: Apple Health integration pending
3. **Database**: Persistence layer ready but not active
4. **Real-time Sync**: Requires backend deployment
